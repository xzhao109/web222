                <strong>gray wolf</strong>, (<em>Canis lupus</em>), also called
                <strong>timber wolf</strong>, largest wild member of the dog family (
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/canine">Canidae</a>). It
                <abbr title="verb: to live in (a place) : to have a home in (a place)">inhabits</abbr> vast areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Between 5 and 24 subspecies of gray wolves are recognized in North America and 7 to 12 are recognized in Eurasia,
                with 1 in Africa. Wolves were
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/domestication">domesticated</a> several thousand years ago, and selective breeding produced

                <p>
                    The global wild wolf population in <time>2003</time> was estimated at 300,000.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMechBoitani2003230-133">[1]</a></sup> Wolf population declines have been arrested since
                    the <time>1970</time>s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for
                    livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the IUCN classifies the wolf as Least Concern on its Red List due
                    to its relatively widespread range and stable population. The species is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<dfn>CITES</dfn>), meaning international trade
                    in the species (including parts and derivatives) is regulated. However, populations of Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan are listed in Appendix I which prohibits commercial international trade in wild-sourced specimens.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf#cite_note-iucn_status_19_November_2021-2">[2]</a></sup>

                <h2>North America</h2>
                <p>
                    In Canada, 50,000-60,000 wolves live in 80% of their historical range, making Canada an important stronghold for the species. Under Canadian law, First Nations people can hunt wolves without restrictions, but others must acquire licenses for the hunting
                    and trapping seasons. As many as 4,000 wolves may be harvested in Canada each year.The wolf is a protected species in national parks under the Canada National Parks Act. In Alaska, 7,000-11,000 wolves are found on 85% of the state's
                    1,517,733 km2 (586,000 sq mi) area. Wolves may be hunted or trapped with a license; around 1,200 wolves are harvested annually. In the contiguous United States, wolf declines were caused by the expansion of agriculture, the decimation
                    of the wolf's main prey species like the American bison, and extermination campaigns.Wolves were given protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, and have since returned to parts of their former range thanks to both
                    natural recolonizations and reintroductions in Yellowstone and Idaho. The repopulation of wolves in Midwestern United States has been concentrated in the Great Lakes states of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan where wolves number over
                    4,000 as of 2018. Wolves also occupy much of the northern Rocky Mountains region, with at least 1,704 wolves in Montana, Idaho and Wyoming as of <time>2015</time>. They have also established populations in Washington
                    and Oregon.In Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States, the Mexican and U.S. governments collaborated from <time>1977</time> to <time>1980</time> in capturing all Mexican wolves remaining in the wild to prevent their extinction
                    and established captive breeding programs for reintroduction.
                </p>

                <h2>Eurasia</h2>
                <p>
                    Europe, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, has 17,000 wolves in more than 28 countries. In many countries of the European Union, the wolf is strictly protected under the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats
                    (Appendix II) and the 1992 Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (Annex II and IV). There is extensive legal protection in many European countries, although there are national
                    exceptions. Wolves have been persecuted in Europe for centuries, having been exterminated in Great Britain by <time>1684</time>, in Ireland by 1770, in Central Europe by <time>1899</time>, in France by the <time>1930</time>s,
                    and in much of Scandinavia by the early 1970s. They continued to survive in parts of Finland, Eastern Europe and Southern Europe.Since <time>1980</time>, European wolves have rebounded and expanded into parts of their former range.
                    The decline of the traditional pastoral and rural economies seems to have ended the need to exterminate the wolf in parts of Europe. As of <time>2016</time>, estimates of wolf numbers include: 4,000 in the Balkans, 3,460-3,849 in the
                    Carpathian Mountains, 1,700-2,240 in the Baltic states, 1,100-2,400 in the Italian peninsula, and around 2,500 in the northwest Iberian peninsula as of <time>2007</time>.
